      "Hey, I’m Khaliil (Khalil), a 17-year-old creator, coder, and dreamer. I’m deeply obsessed with how things are built — from websites to apps, and I spend most of my time learning, designing, and coding. My goal is to become a software engineer and create digital experiences that feel smart, clean, and full of meaning.",
      "This website is a reflection of me, my ideas, my projects, and the moments I capture. I don’t travel often, but when I do, I bring back what inspires me most: the visuals, the sounds, and the stories behind every place.",
